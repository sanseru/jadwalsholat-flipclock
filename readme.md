## 🎯 What is an Unpacked Extension?

An **unpacked extension** is simply a Chrome extension in its raw source code form. It’s perfect for:
- Testing and debugging your own extensions.
- Using extensions that aren’t yet published on the Chrome Web Store.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Google Chrome installed (latest version preferred).
- A folder containing the extension's unpacked files.

> **Tip:** Look for a folder with `manifest.json` inside—it’s the heart of every Chrome extension!
